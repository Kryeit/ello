# Joining the Server

## Installing Our Modpack

Our server IP is: "kryeit.com". But since this is a modded server, you need to install our modpack to join.

## Modrinth App

This is the recommended installation option. We made a 1-minute-long walkthrough video if you don't like reading.

**Instructions:**
1. Download the Modrinth launcher. Visit https://modrinth.com/app for instructions and the download link
2. Click the search icon in the sidebar. Search for "Kryeit" in the Modpacks tab and click "Install".
3. Once in Minecraft, enter the server address "kryeit.com". Have fun!

## CurseForge

1. The CurseForge Team made a tutorial on how to install modpacks here: https://support.curseforge.com/en/support/solutions/articles/9000196984-installing-minecraft-modpacks
2. In the searchbar search for Kryeit and install its latest version. 
3. Once in Minecraft, enter the server address "kryeit.com". Have fun!

## Manual

If you do not want to install any additional programs, you can also use the Modpack through the vanilla launcher. This
option is more tedious than the ones above and not recommended.

We made a 1-minute-long walkthrough video to watch if you don't like reading. It's probably easier watching how it's
done than reading the following instructions.
